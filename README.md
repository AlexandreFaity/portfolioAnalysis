# portfolioAnalysis
This project is a portfolio analysis, using efficient frontier and multiple optimizations.
This is a project based on the following tutorial: 'http://www.bradfordlynch.com/blog/2015/12/04/InvestmentPortfolioOptimization.html'
I used Google Colab to build this script. 
My aim was to understand, replicate and enhance it. 
This is my first real project as developer, please be kind :)
